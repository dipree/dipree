## About me

Hi there, I'm [@dipree](https://github.com/dipree). I'm working for [@github](https://github.com/github/) on the 🐳 Special Projects team as Program Manager. Our goals are [tiny wins](https://joelcalifa.com/blog/tiny-wins/), little changes with a relatively high impact. Our routine is to address papercuts, often multiple times a week. In case something is itching you, we are open to feedback, drop me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/derpixeldan) or [create a discussion](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions) in our public feedback repository.
